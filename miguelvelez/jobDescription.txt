- MIT: Research Intern
    Implemented some features that made the Sketch language more expressive and the engine more powerful for developers. Specifically, developers are now able to use a construct to indicate the synthesizer to use any of the variables, of a specific type, within scope, to derive the missing code. We also included support for lambda expressions, thus providing a lightweight method to create a function within another function that can be used locally or passed to a high-order function. Finally, we also added support for automatic casting of expressions in high-order function calls, which allows the programmer to pass an expression where a function parameter is expected, and the synthesizer then casts it as a lambda expression. All of these features made the Sketch engine easier to use through its enhanced expressiveness and increased the domain of applications that programmers can develop with this engine. 

- Sportradar US with Tricom: Jr. Application Developer
