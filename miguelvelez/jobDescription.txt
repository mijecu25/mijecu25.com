During this time, I improved working under pressure and quick and independent learning of computer technologies. I also progressed on my problem solving, analyzing, recognizing problems, debugging, and programming skills.

- MIT: Research Intern
    Implemented some features that made the Sketch language more expressive and the engine more powerful for developers. Specifically, developers are now able to use a construct to indicate the synthesizer to use any of the variables, of a specific type, within scope, to derive the missing code. We also included support for lambda expressions, thus providing a lightweight method to create a function within another function that can be used locally or passed to a high-order function. Finally, we also added support for automatic casting of expressions in high-order function calls, which allows the programmer to pass an expression where a function parameter is expected, and the synthesizer then casts it as a lambda expression. All of these features made the Sketch engine easier to use through its enhanced expressiveness and increased the domain of applications that programmers can develop with this engine.

I also attended various leadership conferences in the Twin Cities area to improve my leadership skills as well as communicate with other students leaders of other universities to share ideas and experiences. I was also a member of the University of St. Thomas Beverage Committee Fund responsible of assigning $20000 per year to various University of St. Thomas community proposals for durable goods. During this time, I improved my professionalism, independent work, and verbal and written communication skills in addition to learning to prioritize, multitask, supervise others, run an effective meeting, set goals, and be a good motivator and leader to accomplish objectives. 

- UST: Saturday Night Programming Intern, STAR Programming Board
   With an attendance of over 2000 unique students during the year, I planned, implemented, oversaw, and evaluated the "Tommies After Dark" program, which occured every Saturday night from 10:00 p.m. to 12:00 a.m. Along with another intern, we managed responsibly a budget of over $20000 per semester as well as created the "Mystery Bus" event which became a tradition of this program. I also worked with the STAR Advertising and Community Relations interns to publicize our weekly events. During this time I developed my ability to work as a team, be creative, and plan ahead.
